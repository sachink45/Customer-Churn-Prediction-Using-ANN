## üîç Overview

Customer churn occurs when customers stop using a company's services. This project helps businesses identify potential churners so they can take preventive actions.

The model is trained on a telecom customer dataset, and the Streamlit app allows users to input customer data and get a churn prediction instantly.

## üöÄ Streamlit Web App

The `stream.py` file runs a Streamlit application where you can input customer details (e.g., gender, contract type, monthly charges, etc.) and receive a prediction: **Will this customer churn?**

### To run the app locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sachink45/Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-ANN.git

cd Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-ANN

python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate   

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py
